The next step was to legally atomize it into individual saleable units and destroy collective landholding as the basis of tribal life.","Authorized by Congress in 1889, the Cherokee Commission was formed to negotiate the purchase of huge areas of land from the Cherokees, Ioways, Pawnees, Poncas, Tonakawas, Wichitas, Cheyennes, Arapahos, Sac and Fox, and other tribes in Indian Territory. Some humanitarian reformers argued that dissolving tribal holdings into individual private properties would help ""civilize"" the Indians and speed their assimilation into American culture. Whatever the hoped-for effects, the coerced sales opened to white settlement the vast ""unused"" expanses of land that had been held communally by the tribes.

Often called the Jerome Commission after its leading negotiator, David H. Jerome, the commission intimidated Indians into first accepting allotment in severalty and then selling to the United States, at price, the fifteen million acres declared surplus after allotment. This land then went to white settlers, making possible the statehood of Oklahoma at the expense of the Indian tribes who had held claim to it.

""Do you see these papers? Well, they are evidence that I have taken up Seventy-five Thousand Acres of Land in this county--think what an enormous fortune it will be some day! Why, Nancy, enormous don't express it--the word's too tame! I tell you, Nancy--"" 

""For goodness sake, Si --"" 

“Wait, Nancy, wait—let me finish—I’ve been secretly boiling and fuming with this grand inspiration for weeks, and I must talk or I’ll burst! I haven’t whispered to a soul—not a word—have had my countenance under lock and key, for fear it might drop something that would tell even these animals here how to discern the gold mine that’s glaring under their noses. Now all that is necessary to hold this land and keep it in the family is to pay the trifling taxes on it yearly—five or ten dollars—the whole tract would not sell for over a third of a cent an acre now, but some day people will be glad to get it for twenty dollars, fifty dollars, a hundred dollars an acre! What should you say to” [here he dropped his voice to a whisper and looked anxiously around to see that there were no eavesdroppers,] “a thousand dollars an acre!

“Well you may open your eyes and stare! But it’s so. You and I may not see the day, but they’ll see it. Mind I tell you, they’ll see it. Nancy, you’ve heard of steamboats, and may be you believed in them—of course you did. You’ve heard these cattle here scoff at them and call them lies and humbugs,—but they’re not lies and humbugs, they’re a reality and they’re going to be a more wonderful thing some day than they are now. They’re going to make a revolution in this world’s affairs that will make men dizzy to contemplate. I’ve been watching—I’ve been watching while some people slept, and I know what’s coming.

“Even you and I will see the day that steamboats will come up that little Turkey river to within twenty miles of this land of ours—and in high water they’ll come right to it! And this is not all, Nancy—it isn’t even half! There’s a bigger wonder—the railroad! These worms here have never even heard of it—and when they do they’ll not believe in it. But it’s another fact. Coaches that fly over the ground twenty miles an hour—heavens and earth, think of that, Nancy! Twenty miles an hour. It makes a man’s brain whirl. Some day, when you and I are in our graves, there’ll be a railroad stretching hundreds of miles—all the way down from the cities of the Northern States to New Orleans—and its got to run within thirty miles of this land—may be even touch a corner of it. Well, do you know, they’ve quit burning wood in some places in the Eastern States? And what do you suppose they burn? Coal!” [He bent over and whispered again:] “There’s whole worlds of it on this land! You know that black stuff that crops out of the bank of the branch?—well, that’s it. You’ve taken it for rocks; so has every body here; and they’ve built little dams and such things with it. One man was going to build a chimney out of it. Nancy I expect I turned as white as a sheet! Why, it might have caught fire and told everything. I showed him it was too crumbly. Then he was going to build it of copper ore—splendid yellow forty-per-cent. ore! There’s fortunes upon fortunes of copper ore on our land! It scared me to death, the idea of this fool starting a smelting furnace in his house without knowing it, and getting his dull eyes opened. And then he was going to build it of iron ore! There’s mountains of iron ore here, Nancy—whole mountains of it. I wouldn’t take any chances. I just stuck by him—I haunted him—I never let him alone till he built it of mud and sticks like all the rest of the chimneys in this dismal country. Pine forests, wheat land, corn land, iron, copper, coal—wait till the railroads come, and the steamboats! We’ll never see the day, Nancy—never in the world—never, never, never, child. We’ve got to drag along, drag along, and eat crusts in toil and poverty, all hopeless and forlorn—but they’ll ride in coaches, Nancy! They’ll live like the princes of the earth; they’ll be courted and worshiped; their names will be known from ocean to ocean! Ah, well-a-day! Will they ever come back here, on the railroad and the steamboat, and say ‘This one little spot shall not be touched—this hovel shall be sacred—for here our father and our mother suffered for us, thought for us, laid the foundations of our future as solid as the hills!’ ”

Just then, two wealthy Victorians - Ireland’s John George Adair and his American wife, Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie – set sail from Ireland to NY, to begin their Wild West safari. Adair burns for a buffalo trophy, before it’s <i>too late</i>. And lo, in the summer of 1874, they head west under army escort, through a warp between 2 huge events. To their north: Gen. George Armstrong Custer ends his grand Gold Expedition into the Lakota’s sacred Paha Sapa, the Black Hills of Dakota. To their south: Col. Ranald “Bad Hand” Mackenzie spearheads the Red River (Buffalo) War against Commanche, Kiowa and Cheyenne bands who are rejecting the Reservation to save their buffalo and lifeways from destruction. 

Adair fails to bag his trophy, but lands a far better catch -- Charlie Goodnight, a legendary trail blazer gone bust in the Depression. In the wake of America's Centennial and backed by Adair's money, they launch the real “Bonanza” – the Texas Panhandle's founding Cattle Empire. And lo, the vast JA (John Adair) Ranch would rise in the Palo Duro, America’s 2nd biggest canyon. Bordering the Staked Plains, it's set where Indians last tasted freedom. The JA's stunning growth will make Goodnight a Hall of Fame cowboy and John George Adair the world’s biggest Irish-<i>born</i> land owner.

No doubt they will do their journeys by air, and do many, many things that I have not been able to do; but they can never see the prairies of America in their wild uncivilised state, or hunt buffalo over them, nor can they pow-wow with the Red Indians in a camp on the Platte River. So every time has its own special joys, and the great thing is to miss as little as possible, and to share as much.

Every one of these new Western towns is exactly like the others... St. Paul was rather famous for its fur trade from the North,and I saw some beautiful skins of sliver fox, but the trade has diminished. Mr. Blackmore got some interesting Indian relics and a beautiful piece of bead-work. The air here is deliciously pure and clear, and geat numbers of cosumptives come here from the Eastern States, even though the winters are so very severe.

Some call him ""<i>the</i> savior of the buffalo"" for preserving a few for breeding, this after having them driven out of his section of Palo Duro Canyon. Others credit his wife Molly for saving a few. They became the basis of today's Texas State herd. This aspect of the Goodnight legend remains a touchy issue, open to debate. 

The barely remembered ""buffalo savior"" of the northern plains was South Dakota's Frederick Dupree, a French fur trader who came to live near Fort Pierre in 1838, married a Lakota woman, and became a rancher on the Cheyenne River. On the last great buffalo hunt in 1883, he and his sons caught five buffalo calves and took them to their ranch. They turned them loose with the cattle for the winter, grew up and the stayed with the cattle.  On Dupree's death, James (""Scotty"") Philip bought the herd and moved them to his ranch near Fort Pierre. He built a fence around the herd and by 1914, there were four hundred buffalo on his ranch. In 19xx, the state of South Dakota bought 36 buffalo from Philip to start a herd, placing them in Custer State Park.

Some differ, citing the explosion of cattle ranching, championed by players like Goodnight and Adair (and railroad investors), as near destroyers of the species. Others attribute the saving of the JA group to Goodnight's wife Molly (Mary Ann Dyer). Goodnight crossbred them with buffalo to produce cattalo. Other contenders, like the uber trophy-hunter Teddy Roosevelt, are more widely thought of as the buffalo's savior. And, for its part, the world-famous Bronx Zoo (Bronx, NY) restarted a herd in 1899, where some descendants reside to this day. In 1998, the State of Texas agreed to pay the JA for the transfer of its last 50-70 pure bred (98% pure) Goodnight-JA Ranch herd to nearby Caprock Canyon State Park, where they comprise the official state herd.

Little Robe...brought in the Cheyennes. Yellow Bear brought in the Arapahos. A few Commanche leaders - notably Tosawi, who was told by [General] Sheridan that the only good Indian was a dead Indian - also came to surrender. The proud and free Kiowas, however, gave no sign of cooperating, and Sheridan sent Hard Backsides Custer to force them to surrender or to destroy them.

For the Commanches there was something ironic in the government's forcing them to turn away from buffalo hunting to farming. The Commanches had developed an agricultural ecnomy in Texas, but the white men had come there and seized their famrlands, focing them to hunt buffalo in order to survive. Now this kindly old man, [Indian Agent] Bald Head [Lawrie] Tatum, was trying to tell them they should take the white man's road and go to farming, as if the Indians knew nothing of growing corn. Was it not the Indian who first taught the white man how to plant corn and make it grow?

They invited the Commanches and Southern Cheyenne to come as guests, and during the ceremonies many disillusioned warriors talked of staying out on the Plains and living in plenty with buffalo instead of returning to the reservation for meager handouts...

As soon as the dancing was finished, many of the young men rode off to Texas to hunt buffalo and raid the Texans who had taken their lands. They were especially angry against white hunters who were coming down from Kansas to kill thousands of buffalo; the hunters took only the skins, leaving the bloody carcasses to rot on the Plains. To the Kiowas and Commanches the white men seemed to hate everything in nature.

Phil Sheridan's operations against Indians on the Great Plains. Judge for yourself...,"Civilization is extending in opposite directions, Westward across the great Valley of the Mississippi, and Eastward traversing the auriferous regions of the Rocky Mountains, presents two extensive fields of American Industry, apporoximating each other, and demanding a more convenient and rapid intercourse. Railways and Telegraphs have boldly penetrated the solitude of the Plains, and the wild Passes of the Mountains reverbarate to the rumble of moving trains. The two oceans are already linked together by an Iron Highway. The savage, alarmed at this new encroachment, is ready at any moment for a desperate, probably a final effort to drive out the invaders of his hunting-grounds. Fearful of his future he opposes such encroachments, for in them he sees no benefit to the remnant of his race, who have taken refuge on the plains and in the mountains.

The struggle has come, to solve, for all time, the question whether the white or the red man shall prevail in the vast intermediate region between Eastern and Western civilization. The exigencies of modern civilzation point to the inevitable doom of the aboriginal people of the United Stats. Their savage natures, incapable of restraint, render them by instinct foes to progress and the cause of humanity. As with the buffalo, the approach of civilzaiton is to them the knell of destruction. As the murderous bullet of the white hunter ruthlessly slaughters the buffalo, so the vices of civilization carry off those of the red men who have outlived their kindred.

Cartwright, of the Louisiania Medical Association, to explain the tendency of black slaves to flee captivity. While not terming it a disease, Gen. Phil Sheridan helped create and enforce an involuntary ""cure"" for the Plains Indian Problem. Here, he prescribes the reservation system as the only way to achieve ""the management of Indians""...","""I may say in reference to the management of Indians, the reservation system is the only one offering any prospects of success, but all experience has shown that the wild Indian will not adopt it until he is forced to do so. All the tribes on the Northern Pacific coast had to be subdued and forced on the reservations, which was accomplished between the years 1855 and 1860. Then peace ensued. [Actually the US Civil War - ed.] Latterly the same policy has been pursued in regard to the Comanches, Kiowas, Cheyennes, and Arrapahoes.

After the wild Indians are put upon the reservations, a strong military force will have to be kept there to protect the agents and others required in the work of civilization, and also for the subordination of the Indians, and their protection against the encroachments of the white settlers, who otherwise would take possession of their lands.""

<b>Charles Goodnight</b>
A giant of Texas and Panhandle history and lore, this trailblazer and rancher  entered a contract in 1876 with John Adair, and together launched and expanded the JA Ranch. He was bankrupted by the Panic of 1873, until Adair's financing put him back on his ample feet. In his final years, wrongheaded investments led back to virtual bankruptcy. Ironically, he allied with Texas Confederates in the US Civil War; while his partner, Mrs. Adair, was daughter of a Yankee hero-general.

<b>Jot Gunter and Bill Munson</b>
The first purchase of the JA Ranch was 12,000 acres bought by Adair from surveyor-speculators Gunter and Munson at seventy-five cents per acre, with an option to buy 12,000 additional acres. Operating from their home office at Sherman in Grayson County, Jot Gunter, William B. Munson, Sr. filed or controlled major surveys across the Panhandle and with John S. Summerfield. They obtained title to vast tracts of Panhandle acreage by locating their land certificates and surveying on a partnership basis for other land companies. Using money borrowed in Illinois to supplement their own funds, they were among Texas's foremost purchasers of land certificates. Adair and Goodnight had to go through them to have and consolidate the JA.

Thou, O God, shall hear its groan
For of man and all creation
Thou alike art Lord alone.

2. Pity then Thy guiltless creatures
Who, not less, man’s sufferings share
For our sins it is they perish
Let them profit by our prayer.

3. Cast Thine eyes of love and mercy
On the misery of the land

'Tis enough; stay now thine hand.’

Through our pasture lands give peace
Through the Goshen of Thine Israel
Bid the grievous murrain* cease.

Up towards Thy seat of Mercy
Through the forty days of Lent

When earth’s troubles shall be o’er
Give, O Triune God, a portion
With Thyself for evermore.

He rode horseback from Illinois to Texas when he was nine years old. He was hunting with the Caddo Indians beyond the frontier at thirteen, launching into the cattle business at twenty, guiding Texas Rangers at twenty-four, blazing cattle trails two thousand miles in length at thirty, establishing a ranch three hundred miles b eyond the frontier at forty, and at forty-five dominating nearly twenty million acres of range country <i>in the interests of order</i>. At sixty he was recognized as possibly the greatest scientific  breeder of range cattle in the West, and at ninety he was an active international authority on the economics of the range industry.

He always rode beyond the borderlands, upon ranges of unspoiled grass... The vast and changing coutry over which he moved, the fertility of a mind quickly grasped the significance of climate and topography, the inexhaustible engery of his mind and body, and the long period through which he constantly applied himself to the Western World, operated to produce in this man  an ample nature surpassing many of the more famous characters of frontier history.

This was, and is today, known as the J A Ranch. It was established by Colonel Charles Goodnight in 1876 on the Palo Duro Canyon (now spelled Paloduro, since the establishment of a post office at Paloduro, Texas). This ranch was located in what is now Armstrong, Briscoe, Donley, Hall, Randall and Swisher Counties. The main ranch was divided into two ranches, the J A Ranch and the J J Ranch, when the ranch was first established. A little later, 1884, the holdings got so large that still another ranch was located, known as the Tule Ranch. In 1882 the Quitaque Ranch, better known as the F Ranch, was established and managed by Colonel Goodnight for Mrs. Adair. It was located in Briscoe, Floyd, and Motley Counties. The land holdings were gradually increased by purchase and lease until at one time the land actually grazed by the combined interests reached a total of more than a million acres. The herd was increased until at one time there were about nine thousand head of high-grade Hereford cattle and over 60,700 in the main herd with a calf branding of sixteen thousand head, not including the F Ranch cattle. Today the J A Ranch includes part of the original holdings of the J A and J J Ranches only, and there are only 397,800 acres of land and about 25,000 head of cattle.

While barely remembered, this event broke Indian resistance on the Southern Plains and catalyzed Westward Expansion.","""Still another detachment was employed in rounding up the pony herd and getting it out of the Canon by the same trail we had already used.

As our skirmish line advanced, the Indians retired, springing from one rock to the protection of another, until finally they took to the inaccessible sides of the Canon once more; then, in order to hold the large number of ponies captured the command commenced to withdraw from the Canon, which was finally vacated between 3 and 4 o'clock p.m. The whole command now assembled, with the immense herd of captured ponies, on the high prairie (""Staked Plains""). A ""hollow square"" or huge parallelogram was formed as follows: One troop in line of battle rode in advance; on either side marched two troops in column of twos; and one troop, in line, rode in rear. In the center of this huge hollow square the captured herd of about 2000 was driven along. One troop marched in rear of all as rear guard. It was a living corral and our march was nearly 20 miles.

On September 29th reveille was late. Immediately after breakfast a detail was made to shoot the captured ponies, which, owing to the great number, it was found impossible to take along and properly guard them, or to take them into the nearest military post-the nearest being nearly two hundred miles away. The Indians would follow us and be upon us every night in an effort to stampede and recapture them. Experience had been our lesson. The number, as has been stated, were variously estimated at from 1500 to 2200. The ""Tonks' were permitted to select the best. Numbers of them were young and handsome, and it seemed a pity to be compelled to kill them, but there was no other alternative. It was the surest method of crippling the Indians and compelling them to go into and stay upon their reservations which they had fled from. Many were the best race ponies they had and many pesos had been waged upon them. Some were used to replace those which had died on the march or been wounded in the fight. It was a heavy blow. They were such valuable property that they were held in higher esteem than their squaws. 

It took Lawton the most of one day, with one troop, to pile these bodies up on the plains. They were still there-on the ""Tex"" Rogers ranch some years ago-an enigma to the average Texas boy who looked upon them with wondering eyes.""

The penetration of the plains by the transcontinental railroads had split theri grazing grounds, put hide hunting on to a commerical basis, and accelerated slaughter to an industrial pace. The southern buffalo population was near extinction by the time of the Red River War; the northern population was in catastrophic decline also. 

Deforestation had been the necessary preliminary to settlement in the temperate United States; the buffalo holocaust was the equivalent precondition to the opening of the plains. It was immeasurably easier and it had the direct side-effect of forcing the Indians to choose between acceptance of dependency on the whites through the reservation system or increasingly desperate armed resistance.

The Cohardie Commanches, the scourge of Texas and the Southwest, were in 1874 attacked by Mackenzie with the 4th Cavalry, at their camp in the Paladuro Canyon of the Staked Plains.

Sullivan's 1779 victory over the Iroquois.","""I do not intend to occupy but one or two minutes of your time, because I am conscious that you look upon me simply as one of the curiosities of the day. But, my friends, we are all at war. Ever since the first white man landed upon this continent, there has been a battle. We are at war to-day—a war between civilization and savages. Our forefathers, when they first landed upon this continent, came to found an empire based upon new principles, and all opposition to it had to pass away, whether it be English or French on the north, or Indians on the west; and no one knew it better than our father, Washington. [Applause.] He gave General Sullivan orders to come here and punish the Six Nations, for their cruel massacre in the valley of the Wyoming, and to make it so severe that it would not occur again. And he did so. General Sullivan obeyed his orders like a man and like a soldier, and the result was from that time forward, your people settled up these beautiful valleys all around here, and look at their descendants here—a million almost. [Applause.]

If it had not been for General Sullivan and the men who followed him from Easton, and Clinton's force that came across from Albany, probably some of you would not have been here to-day.

Battles are not measured by their death-roll, but by their results, and it makes no difference whether one man was killed or five hundred, if the same result followed. This valley was opened to civilization; it came on the heels of General Sullivan's army, and has gone on, and gone on until to-day. The same battle is raging upon the Yellow Stone. The same men, endowed by the same feelings that General Sullivan's army had, to-day are contending with the same causes and the same races, two thousand miles west of here; not for the purpose of killing, not for the purpose of shedding blood, not for the purpose of doing wrong at all; but to prepare the way for that civilization which must go along wherever yonder flag floats. [Applause.]

I know it is a very common, and too common a practice, to accuse General Sullivan of having destroyed peach trees and cornfields, and all that nonsense. He had to do it, and he did do it. Why does the Almighty strike down the tree with lightning? Why does [440] He bring forth the thunder storm? To purify the air, so that the summer time may come, and the harvest and the fruits. And so with war. When all things ought to be peaceful, war comes and purifies the atmosphere. So it was with our Civil War; that purified the atmosphere; we are better for it; you are better for it; we are all better for it. Wherever men raise up their hands to oppose this great advancing tide of civilization, they must be swept aside, peaceably if possible, forcibly if we must...""

...The troubles were not ended when they arrived at their destination, because it was just a few days after their arrival that Jot Gunter, a speculator, put in a blanket survey covering the whole section of country which Colonel Goodnight had planned to use for his ranch, and hence, he surveyed them in.

<center>Expansion and Growth of the Ranch</center>

<center>PART I.  GROWTH OF THE RANCH</center>

In pursuance of the contract made between Adair and Goodnight in 1877, Colonel Goodnight bought the first twelve thousand acres of the J A Ranch from Gunter and Munson in 1877. The rare judgment displayed by Colonel Goodnight in selecting this first twelve thousand acres and in contracting for twelve thousand acres more to be bought the following year spelled success for the enterprise. Colonel Goodnight gives the following account of this transaction:

Adair furnished only money enough to buy twelve thousand acres. I knew that would not monopolize the ranch business, but I wanted to stay. However, the bad part of it was that Adair got mixed up with Gunter and Munson and they were too smart for him and the result was that they held me up for one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre on the twelve thousand acres. I had to get it through them or take my chances, and I wanted that canyon. I got them down to six bits an acre and closed for twelve thousand. acres, provided they would let me set the compass and. they would run it; and that is where that Old Crazy Quilt comes in. I took all the good land and all the water I could get and under the contract they were to let me designate twelve thousand acres more that I was to take the next year at my option. Well, I scattered that all over the Palo Duro Canyon; every good ranch in the country, every place a man was liable to come, I took. It cost like the devil to survey it. We surveyed for four or five days, and Gunter got to kicking and said, ""Why don't you take this land?"" I said, ""I don't want it.""

One was a major survey along the Canadian River. When Goodnight first came to Palo Duro Canyon in 1876, he found that Gunter had surveyed him in.

Texans never agreed to accept the existence of western Plains Indians in the state under any circumstances. It was this denial, this refusal to accept ethnic diversity - seemingly inevitable given the Southern code - that condemned Texas to a history of violence and instability.

The hide men followed a few days later.""","In 1877 the Texas bison had retreated to the Staked Plains, the Llano Estacado of Texas and Oklahoma. Among the southern plains tribes, it is widely believed that the bison first sprang from the earth in the canyons here. Archaeological evidence indicates that both bison and bison hunting are ancient in Texas. 

In 1877, the place was deep in one of the West's  periodic droughts. Then there came a meteorological oddity, a waterspout that poured in across the land and built a great shallow lake. The thousands of bison of the Texas herd had been well away from the lake when it formed, but evolved as they had been in a place of drought and wind, they caught the scent of water on the air and began a great motion, until the broad shadow lake became a wallow of virtually all the southern herd.

The hide men followed a few days later, at first thirsty themselves, hectoring off bison and wolves so that they and their horses could drink. <i>Then they killed.</i> A pair of hunters took 6,200 hides in the next few months. A lone man working to the south of them took 4,900. All around the Llano it was the same; wherever a seep or draw popped up, the bison congregated in their evolved defense against drought, a defense that rendered them helpless against a new enemy. The new enemy was not man, taking drought-bunched animals here just as he had in Clovis times when the mammoth bunched around that water hole in Arizona's San Pedro Valley. The enemy was this new man, whose railroads, like a lens, could focus the hungers of men of an entire world to burn on a single spot in Texas.

By 1878, the southern herd was gone, save a relict band that was to roam the plains until a cowboy spotted and fired on them in 1886. A hunting party took all of them, fifty-two animals, that winter.

By spring there were at least two thousand hide hunters in the region. One party of sixteen men killed 28,000 buffalo. The railroads admitted to shipping 1,378,359 hides between 1872 and 1894, but General Nelson A. Miles reported at the time that the kill was closer to 4.5 million.

   The great herds of the middle region were wiped out then, and the kill moved south to Texas for its second major phase. Fort Worth replaced Dodge as teh trade center only three years after trade at Dodge had begun. In the fall of 1875, Tom Nixon set a new record for the southern hunters. From September 15 to October 20, he alone killed 2,173 bison. The following year a London newspaper would label the hunting ""a scandal to civilization,"" a protest that was echoed on this continent. But it was already becoming clar the scandal ran much deeper than an assault on wildlife. It was not so much a scandal to civilization as it was the imposition of civilization.

Frémont used the railroad's land grant as collateral for bonds he sold in France, but the company only graded a few extra miles. Frémont and his associates soon incorporated The Southern Trans-Continental Railway Company on July 27, 1870, to acquire the Memphis, El Paso and Pacific and to build along its projected route to El Paso as well as between Jefferson and Texarkana, but this company also did no work. The Memphis, El Paso and Pacific remained independent, however, as both it and the Southern Trans-Continental were sold to the Texas and Pacific Railway Company on June 12, 1873,and March 30, 1872, respectively. The Texas and Pacific built from Marshall through Jefferson to Texarkana in 1872 and 1873 and finally completed the projected Memphis, El Paso and Pacific line between Texarkana and Fort Worth in 1880.

The tallow was of poor quality and never commanded a very good price. The hides proved to make an inferior quality of leather, and consequently depreciated in value; the prevailing price for average hides benig about $1.00 during the greater part of the slaughtering period, and the meat sold for about 2 1/2 to 3 cents per pound. The humps, or saddles, hams and tongues was the only meat the hunter preserved, and countless thousands of buffalo were killed only for their hides, but as a buffalo in good flesh would yieled about 400 pounds of choice meat his gross valuews about $11.

No pen picture can every portray the full significance of these bones. They spoke of a slaughter unparalleled in the annals of history, of the passing of the animals that had been the savages' principal wealth and support: of the passing of civilization's last barrier in its westward march on the American continent, and told a story of hardships, suffering and endurance seldom equaled in the wild struggles for wealth; but when railroads were built across the country, affording convenient shipping facilities, these reminders were quickly converted into channels more profitable than sentimental. As these bones made excellent quality of fertilizer they readily commmanded from five to six dollars per ton and before <b>the bone era</b> closed, they sold for twice that amount.
