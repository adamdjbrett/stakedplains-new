  "Larry McMurtry's description of the Sand Creek Massacre of Cheyenne in 1864 seems just as true of Mackenzie's record destruction of at least 1,500 Commanche-Kiowa horses in Tule Canyon, only ten years later (September 1874)."

What remained on that field was a meat shop, a deathscape out of Breughel.... People confronted with massacres at first want to know how many died - a little later some of them begin to want to know why.
