This oldest and most powerful and still existent cattleman's association of the Texas Panhandle was formed in 1877 by the top 40 new ranchers of the region. This was the year the JA truly sprung into action. Cross the cattleman and there'd be a _price_ to pay! Big Property was organizing as never before against nomadism and rustling -- so Billy the Kid beware!
