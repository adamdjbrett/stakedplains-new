<p>America&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;Gilded Age rises from the brutal Depression of 1873-1879. Just then, two wealthy Victorians - Ireland&rsquo;s John George Adair and his American wife, Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie &ndash; set sail from Ireland to NY, to begin their Wild West safari. Adair burns for a buffalo trophy, before it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>too late</em>. And lo, in the summer of 1874, they head west under army escort, through a warp between 2 huge events. To their north: Gen. George Armstrong Custer ends his grand Gold Expedition into the Lakota&rsquo;s sacred Paha Sapa, the Black Hills of Dakota. To their south: Col. Ranald &ldquo;Bad Hand&rdquo; Mackenzie spearheads the Red River (Buffalo) War against Commanche, Kiowa and Cheyenne bands who are rejecting the Reservation to save their buffalo and lifeways from destruction.</p>
<p>Adair fails to bag his trophy, but lands a far better catch -- Charlie Goodnight, a legendary trail blazer gone bust in the Depression. In the wake of America's Centennial and backed by Adair's money, they launch the real &ldquo;Bonanza&rdquo; &ndash; the Texas Panhandle's founding Cattle Empire. And lo, the vast JA (John Adair) Ranch would rise in the Palo Duro, America&rsquo;s 2nd biggest canyon. Bordering the Staked Plains, it's set where Indians last tasted freedom. The JA's stunning growth will make Goodnight a Hall of Fame cowboy and John George Adair the world&rsquo;s biggest Irish-<em>born</em>&nbsp;land owner.</p>
<p>These traces remain, hidden in plain sight:</p>
