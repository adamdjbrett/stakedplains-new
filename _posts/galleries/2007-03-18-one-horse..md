The destruction of at least 1500 horses under military necessity is the hallmark of Mackenzie's "clearance" of Palo Duro Canyon. It took nearly a year for the last free band, Quanah Parker's Quohadi's, to return to Ft. Sill, after "the wrinkled hand chase" -- a frigid winter of relentless hunger and hot pursuit. (Detail from painting by David Sprecher.)
