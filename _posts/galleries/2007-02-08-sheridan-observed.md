A sarcastic 19th century view by England's famed Puck Magazine of Gen. Phil Sheridan and Interior Secretary Carl Schurz's exhausting passion for Indian Management on the Great Plains. During their tenures, the Indian Bureau was responsible for: the avoidable Nez Perce War in 1877; crushing the Northern Cheyenne Exodus from Indian Territory in 1878; refusing to allow Poncas to return to the guaranteed reservation on the Missouri River; reneging on the promise to return the Northern Paiute bands that helped the U.S. in the Bannock War to their Nevada homelands in 1880.
