Ranald "Bad Hand" Mackezie was the primary scourge and pursuer of Indians in the Red River War. He ordered his men to destroy over 1500 captured horses in Tule Canyon, breaking the military capability, if not identity of the Commanches. With near karmic precision, he suffers a psychic breakdown on the eve of his wedding, only to spend the rest of his last days in a New York asylum. Mackenzie is buried in the cemetery at West Point.
