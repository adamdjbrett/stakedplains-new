  "Elmer Kelton reminds us that part of the Southwest's tragedy lies in how black Buffalo Soldiers, not a few being former slaves, were deployed to fight and uproot Plains Indians from their homelands. "It would be tempting to visualize their forming an alliance..."

To the Indian, the buffalo soldier was simply another white man whose face happened to be black. To the black soldier, the Indian was the same deadly enemy he appeared to the whites. In retrospect it is evident that the former slaves and the Indians had much in common. It would be tempting to visualize their forming an alliance. But in history it seldom happened. An occasional escaped slave found sanctuary among Indians, but most often such runaways found only further enslavement, or, more likely, sudden death. Neither slave nor Indian seemed to recognize the potential common bond.
