Known back home as "Black Jack" but in Texas as "[an English aristocrat](http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/JJ/apj1.html "an English aristocrat")," Ireland's own (or disowned) John George Adair came to the Panhandle in 1877 with his wife Cornelia and Charles Goodnight to hands-on establish the JA Ranch. After his death in 1885, Mrs. Adair and Goodnight continue the enterprise until 1887, and then part ways.
