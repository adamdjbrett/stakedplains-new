An image of the 1872 U.S. penny, all decked out in an Indan Headress, emblazoned with an homage to Liberty. This appears on the eve of America's depression of 1873. In a sense it is prophetic of measures in the wings to restore the nation's economic confidence: Custer's Gold Expedition in the Lakota's sacred Black Hills and Sherman-Sheridan's war against the Commanche, Kiowa and Cheyenne on the Southern Plains. It is likely that the Adair's saw this "coin of the realm" on their 1874 buffalo hunt.
