***
The wind is the oldest river, rhythmic,  \\
Unceasing, infinite, the pulse of God.  \\
Where time is the blood in which tghe Lano  \\
is washed, where the horizon is the line  \\
Cut from foreever by tghe eddies  \\
Of this current, spinning and swriling  \\
On the nether edge of sight, patient as starlight,  \\
There we ride like Coronado, his breath  \\
At our backs and our eyes screwed to his dreams  \\
Of shining cities floating over the prairie.  \\
There, like Quanah Parker, we are waves  \\
On this river, riding ponies like fishes,  \\
Sleek, quick, nimble. And, like Goodnight,  \\
There we ride with the wind in our faces  \\
Until we find its roots, until the last  \\
Gust lies still and settled on the fences,  \\
Until the wind is a river no more.  \\
