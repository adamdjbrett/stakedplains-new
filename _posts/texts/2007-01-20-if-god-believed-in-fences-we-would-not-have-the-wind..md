Mi compadre, Buenas Noches,  \\
Goodnight, my old friend,  \\
I am wandering in my own land  \\
And I can't get home again.  \\
We have lost the buffalo  \\
Will we be lost like them?  \\
Mi compadre, Buenas Noches,  \\
Goodnight, my old friend.  \\

There's only one Great Spirit  \\
For all the tribes of men;  \\
If He believed in hatred,  \\
We would not be friends;  \\
If he believed in fences,  \\
We would not have the wind,  \\
No, if God believed in fences,  \\
We would not have the wind.  \\

I asked for help in Clarendon,  \\
I said "I am Standing Deer."  \\
But the trail to my pueblo  \\
You've hidden in barbed-wires.  \\
I cannot travel by the sun,  \\
I cannot use the stars,  \\
For the trail to my pueblo  \\
You've hidden in barbed-wires.  \\

Mi compadre, Buenas Noches,  \\
Goodnight, my old friend,  \\
I am wandering in my own land  \\
And I can't get home again.  \\
We have lost the buffalo  \\
Will we be lost like them?  \\
Mi compadre, Buenas Noches,  \\
Goodnight, my old friend.  \\
