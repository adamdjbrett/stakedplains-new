  "Remnants of the Buffalo Wars"
***

In 1874, Mackenzie's destruction of Commanche-Kiowa horses left a mountain of bones 50 feet high. Buffalo bones were piled high across the West, even as late as this 1895 photo. Most were sold, turned into commercial fertilizer, and spread across the farms of the Great Plains.
