This arguably is the last free ancestral dwelling place of the Haudenosaunee/Seneca of the Iroquois Six Nations; burnt out by the Sullivan-Clinton Campaign of 1779 and ousted by the subsequent Buffalo Creek Treaties with the land-hungry "Empire State" of New York. Today, as NY's Letchworth State Park, it stands only miles from where Cornelia Adair was raised and may well have been viewed by John Adair on his visits with her to western NY.
