A solarized take on the shockwaves unleashed on Commancheria and other Plains Indians by Mackenzie's destruction of over 1500 Commanches, just two miles across the fields in Palo Duro Canyon.

By so "pacifying" the region, land surveys could ensue or continue and ranches, like Adair's JA Ranch, be founded.
